<h2>Who Is Burt?</h2>
<p>I’m a veteran software engineer with over 23 years of experience, driven by a passion for solving complex technical puzzles and building resilient, high-quality systems. My career is defined not only by my technical achievements but also by personal growth, perseverance, and an unwavering commitment to excellence.</p>

<h2>My Early Path &amp; Journey</h2>
<p>My journey wasn’t always straightforward. In college, I explored civil engineering and even delved into food science—paths that proved difficult, partly because of learning challenges I wasn’t fully aware of at the time. Everything changed when I took my first computer science course; I devoured the textbook before the semester began and discovered a genuine passion for coding and problem-solving. Encouraged by supportive professors and friends, I pursued a master’s in computer science—a decision that set me firmly on the path I cherish today.</p>
<p>During a break from my studies in 2003, I joined a small startup called eHana. In that fast-paced, close-knit environment of just seven people, I wore multiple hats—from developer to project manager and tester. Working directly with clients and rapidly rolling out features taught me to capture requirements quickly and make thoughtful decisions on the fly, laying the foundation for the adaptability and resilience that have guided my career ever since.</p>

<h2>Lessons in Resilience</h2>
<p>Before my professional career truly took off, high school wrestling on Oahu taught me the meaning of endurance. Training three hours a day under grueling conditions pushed me to my physical and mental limits. That spirit of persistence—pushing through when the odds are against you—continues to drive me when tackling elusive bugs, designing innovative systems, and leading teams through challenging projects.</p>

<h2>My Experience at 21CSI (2005 – 2010)</h2>
<p>After earning my Master’s in 2005, I joined 21CSI—a research and development startup contracted by the U.S. Navy. Under the mentorship of Bruce, I quickly emerged as one of the lead engineers, working on pioneering tactical decision aids for battle scenarios. From developing a tactical simulator to designing the Force Disposition Manager with Google Maps, I honed my skills in object-oriented design, advanced algorithms, and system architecture. I also embraced roles in documentation, configuration management, and mentoring—experiences that solidified both my technical foundation and leadership abilities.</p>

<h2>My Experience at Amazon (2010 – 2013)</h2>
<p>When 21CSI closed its Hawaii office, I set my sights on Seattle and made the bold decision to move without a job lined up. At Amazon, I began as a contractor on the Target website and quickly proved my technical abilities, earning a full-time role as a Support Engineer III. Working on mission-critical systems that impacted millions of users, I mastered Linux and bash scripting while tackling complex issues with a focus on production quality. The competitive, fast-paced environment taught me how to navigate ambiguity and high stakes with determination and grace.</p>

<h2>My Experience at REI (2013 – 2024)</h2>
<p>After leaving Amazon, I sought a friendlier, more purpose-driven environment—and REI’s culture of trust, collaboration, and commitment to its members resonated with me. Over 11 years at REI, I became known as the go-to problem solver. Whether it was a critical defect in the payments system or a challenging integration issue, colleagues turned to me when the toughest problems arose. My methodical, quality-focused approach ensured that production code never broke, and I consistently delivered robust, reliable solutions. Projects like cross-team Kafka integrations, innovative Salesforce user provisioning, and mobile restock applications not only sharpened my technical skills but also reinforced my reputation as someone who rises to any challenge—even amidst office politics.</p>

<h2>Adaptability and Continuous Learning</h2>
<p>One of my greatest strengths is my ability to quickly learn and master new programming languages, frameworks, and APIs. Although REI’s primary tech stack centered on Java, I eagerly embraced opportunities to expand my horizons—whether it was rapidly picking up the Salesforce API for a user provisioning project or exploring Ruby, Groovy, and other technologies. This passion for continuous learning not only enriches my work but also keeps me versatile in an ever-evolving technological landscape. Outside the realm of code, I also draw inspiration from motorcycling—the thrill, balance, and risk management required on the open road mirror my approach to software engineering. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-past-hobby-joy-motorcycling-burt-leung-wpkmf?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base%3B79Q9AMjZQoO2vCQREX7Urg%3D%3D" target="_blank">Read more about how these passions intersect in my LinkedIn article.</a></p>

<h2>My Engineering Philosophy</h2>
<p>I view building great software as solving an ever-evolving puzzle. I prioritize:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Quality over speed:</strong> Crafting robust, thoroughly tested solutions that stand the test of time.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative innovation:</strong> Leveraging diverse perspectives to design scalable, future-proof systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous learning:</strong> Embracing every challenge as an opportunity to refine my skills and processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These guiding principles shape my technical decisions and inform the way I mentor teams and lead projects.</p>

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>I thrive on tackling intricate challenges and building systems that leave a lasting impact. As I continue my journey toward a principal engineer role, I’m eager to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities that push the boundaries of technology.
