    <h3>More Coming Soon!</h3>
    <p>
      I’m currently working on a personal side project: a Golang-based budgeting tool that
      uses AI to forecast expenses. ...I’ve been doing Java for quite a while now, so this is
      my chance to dive into full-stack development with Go, Postgres, and AI integrations.
      I’ll be pushing the source code to GitHub soon, so stay tuned!
