<h2>Aloha!</h2> <!-- or remove this line if you want no heading at all -->

<p>I’m Burt Leung, a seasoned software engineer with over 20 years of experience in
  developing and architecting robust systems. My journey in technology has been as
  dynamic as my adventures on the open road—each experience has taught me valuable
  lessons in risk management, precision, and resilience.</p>

<p>Right now, you’ll find a “coming soon” section where I’ll soon showcase a variety of
  projects that reflect my passion for innovative problem-solving and quality-driven
  development. One highlight to look forward to is a detailed case study on a reusable
  plugin I designed to streamline cross-team integrations—a project that encapsulates
  my commitment to creating scalable, future-proof solutions.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore my projects or drop me a note through the
  contact page. I’m excited to share more soon!</p>
