<h2>Aloha!</h2> <!-- or remove this line if you want no heading at all -->

<p>I’m Burt Leung, a seasoned software engineer with over 23 years of experience in
  developing and architecting robust systems. My journey in technology has been as
  dynamic as my adventures on the open road—each experience has taught me valuable
  lessons in risk management, precision, and resilience.</p>

<p>On my Projects page, you’ll find a mix of current work and teasers for what’s next—
  including a detailed case study on a reusable plugin I designed to streamline cross-team
  integrations. It’s a great example of my commitment to creating scalable, future-proof
  solutions, and I’m excited to add even more soon!</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore my projects or drop me a note through the
  contact page. I’m excited to share more soon!</p>
