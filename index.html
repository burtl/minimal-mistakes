<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Welcome to my digital portfolio! I’m Burt Leung, a seasoned software engineer with over 20 years of experience in
  developing and architecting robust systems. My journey in technology has been as dynamic as my adventures on the open
  road — each experience, whether on a motorcycle or in the code, has taught me valuable lessons in risk management,
  precision, and resilience.</p>

<p>Right now, you’ll find a “coming soon” section where I’ll soon showcase a variety of projects that reflect my passion
  for innovative problem-solving and quality-driven development. One highlight to look forward to is a detailed case
  study on a reusable plugin I designed to streamline cross-team integrations — a project that encapsulates my commitment
  to creating scalable, future-proof solutions.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting. I hope my work inspires you as much as it has fueled my own journey in technology. Enjoy your stay, and please check back for updates!</p>
